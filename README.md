# Capstone - A Machine Learning Analysis of the 2022 Australian Federal Election

This was the final project in my Data Science course. I explored how survey-based clustering and machine learning classification can be used to better understand and predict voting behaviour. Below are the project requirements:

The capstone project will allow you to showcase skills learned throughout the course by defining, designing and delivering an end-to-end data science solution.
Students must prepare a 10-minute PowerPoint presentation (please keep Jupyter Notebook handy for technical presentation). This presentation will occur on the last day of the course.

The PowerPoint presentation should cover the following:
1. Business Problem
2. Data Science Problem
3. Stakeholders
4. Dataset
5. EDA
6. Models
7. Evaluation and comparison
8. Result
9. Conclusion / Future Work

The Jupyter Notebook should be readable and well-commented
